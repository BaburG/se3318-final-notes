# SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION

# METAPHOR

*   A metaphor serves more as a **heuristic** than it does as an algorithm.
*   A heuristic tells you only **how to look**, not what to find.

---

# COMMON METAPHORS

*   Software Penmanship: Writing Code
*   Software Farming: Growing a System
*   Software Oyster Farming: System Accretion
*   Software Construction: Building Software

# SOFTWARE PENMANSHIP: WRITING CODE

![A trash can overflowing with crumpled paper.](image.png)

*   Considering developing a program is like writing a casual letter.
*   Writing is usually a one-person activity.
*   When you finish writing a letter, you stuff it into an envelope and mail it.

# SOFTWARE FARMING: GROWING A SYSTEM

![A cartoon drawing of a tractor planting binary code (101 100010 10.1.0) as seeds, which grow into corn stalks under a raining cloud and sun.](image.png)

> Creating software as something like planting seeds and growing crops.

---

# SOFTWARE FARMING: GROWING A SYSTEM

*   Periodic Attention: Each feature receives **focused** and **timely maintenance** and updates similar to how crops are managed throughout their growth cycle.
*   Scalability: With proper care, a system can **grow in complexity** (like farming techniques improve over time) without becoming **unmanageably complex**.
*   Iterative Development: Each part is treated as an **individual unit**, allowing for **efficient and focused development**.

---

# SOFTWARE OYSTER FARMING: SYSTEM ACCRETION

*   Growth or increase in size by a gradual external addition or inclusion.
*   It doesn't have to accept realistic input, it doesn't have to perform realistic manipulations on data, it doesn't have to produce realistic output.

> *This basic beginning is like the oyster's beginning a pearl with a small grain of sand.*

---

# SOFTWARE OYSTER FARMING: SYSTEM ACCRETION

*   Gradual Accumulation: System grow **incrementally** with each new project or feature.
*   Complexity Increase: The system **becomes more complex** as it accumulates **more layers of functionality** and **interdependencies**.
*   Difficult to Maintain: Managing the system will become challenging due to its complexity, making it difficult to **maintain, update,** and **troubleshoot**.

# POP QUIZ 1: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

Which method has more control over what features are added when?

---

# POP QUIZ 1: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

| System Accretion | Software Farming |
| :--- | :--- |
| System accretion **has no planned control over what features added when**, it grows organically. | In Software Farming features are treated like crops that carefully planted, watered, fertilized at different stages. **This implies more controlled approach with clear planning.** |

---

# POP QUIZ 2: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

Which method leads to more complexity and why?

---

# POP QUIZ 2: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

| System Accretion | Software Farming |
| :--- | :--- |
| System Accretion implies a system that **grows organically**, with **no clear boundaries or planning**, leading to complexity. | Software Farming suggests a more **controlled approach** where **each feature managed individually**, potentially avoiding unmanageable complexity. |

---

# POP QUIZ 3: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

Which approach requires more maintenance effort?

---

# POP QUIZ 3: GROWING A SYSTEM VS SYSTEM ACCRETION

| System Accretion | Software Farming |
| :--- | :--- |
| System Accretion: High maintenance effort as the **system becomes complex over time**. | Software Farming: Focuses on individual features or projects needing attention at various points in their lifecycle. **Each feature requires care but doesn't add to overall complexity.** |

---

# SOFTWARE CONSTRUCTION: BUILDING SOFTWARE

*   Compatible with the idea of software accretion but provides **more detailed guidance**.
*   The building process is more complicated, and so are the **consequences of poor design**.

# FAMILIAR LIES: THE FIRST

> *We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!*

---

# UNFAMILIAR TRUTHS: THE FIRST

> *They can't go back and clean things up because they've got to get the next feature done, and the next, and the next, and the next.*

---

# FAMILIAR LIES: THE SECOND

> *Developers buy into the notion that writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and just slows them down in the long term.*

---

# UNFAMILIAR TRUTHS: THE SECOND

> *Making messes is **always** slower than staying clean, no matter which time scale you are using.*
>
> The only way to go fast, is to go well.

---

# FAMILIAR LIES: THE THIRD

> *Start over from scratch and redesign the whole system.*

The same overconfidence that led to the mess is now telling them that they can build it better if only they can start the race over.

---

# UNFAMILIAR TRUTHS: THE THIRD

> *Their overconfidence will drive the redesign into the **same mess** as the original project.*

# WHAT TO EXPECT?

![Book cover for Clean Architecture by Robert C. Martin.](image.png)
*Robert C. Martin Series*
*Clean Architecture*
*A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design*
*Robert C. Martin*
*With contributions by James Grenning and Simon Brown*
*Foreword by Kevlin Henney*
*Afterword by Jason Gorman*

> Read Chapter 1.
>
> Expect exact opposite behavior from non-technical managers.

# KEY POINTS

*   Metaphors are **heuristics, not algorithms**. As such, they tend to be a little sloppy.
*   Metaphors help you understand the **software-development process** by relating it to other activities you already know about.
*   **No single tool is right for every job.** Choosing the right tool for each problem is one key to being an effective programmer.
*   Metaphors are not mutually exclusive. **Use the combination of metaphors that works best for you.**
*   **Don't buy into unfamiliar lies.**
