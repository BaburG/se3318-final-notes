# AIM OF THE COURSE

*   Form a deeper understanding of software development process.
*   Teach best practices for change management, writing specifications, smoke tests and coding.

---

# WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO YOU?

*   Software engineering isn't about coding entirely but **planning, managing and executing the development process.** Total of this processes called "construction".
*   You need to be able to understand various aspects of the construction process in terms of both **technical responsibilities** and **your career path.**
